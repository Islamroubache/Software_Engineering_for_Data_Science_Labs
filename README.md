# ðŸ§  Software Engineering for Data Science Labs

This repository contains my solutions for all the laboratory exercises of the "Software Engenering for Data Science" course at the Higher School of Computer Science (08 May 1945), Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, for 1st-year Master's students specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 01: Introduction to Data Science

In this lab, we introduce the basic concepts of Data Science and explore various use cases and applications. We also discuss the essential tools and skills required to become a data scientist.

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 02: Getting Started with Python & Jupyter Notebook

This lab covers the basics of Python programming and how to use Jupyter Notebooks for data science projects. Topics include variables, data types, loops, functions, and more.

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 03: Advanced Concepts for Python Software Engineering: Modularity, Readability, and Refactoring

We dive into advanced software engineering principles, focusing on modular programming, improving code readability, and the importance of refactoring. Best practices for organizing Python code are also discussed.

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 04: Advanced Concepts for Python Software Engineering: Unit Testing, Git, and Github

This lab introduces unit testing to ensure code reliability and correctness, along with an overview of using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration in software projects.

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 05: Data Processing & Cleaning for Data Science: Data Ingestion and Wrangling with Pandas

We explore how to use the Pandas library to ingest, clean, and transform data. Data wrangling techniques are covered in-depth to prepare datasets for analysis.

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 06: Data Wrangling Documents and Web Scraping

In this lab, we focus on document processing and web scraping to extract useful information from unstructured data sources like PDFs, HTML pages, and web APIs using Python libraries.

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 07: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization â€“ Going Deeper

This notebook covers advanced techniques in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, allowing us to gain deeper insights from the data.

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 08: Statistics For Data Science

We delve into statistical concepts and their application in data science, covering topics such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, probability distributions, and inferential statistics.

### ðŸ“ˆ Lab 09: Web Development for Data Science: Building RESTful API with FastAPI

In this final lab, we learn how to develop and deploy a RESTful API using FastAPI, which allows for the integration of data science models into web applications and services.
